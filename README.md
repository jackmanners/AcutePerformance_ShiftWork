## Requirements
Found in `requirements.txt`, the following are required to run these models. The only version requirement should be `scikit-learn`, though other versions are included if problems arise.

This was created and tested in Python v3.11.4. Other versions should work provided scikit-learn compatability, but this is untested.

```
joblib 
# joblib==1.3.2
numpy
# numpy==1.26.2
pandas 
# pandas==2.1.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
```
